WIRING ORDER:
============
1. Connect all GND connections first
2. Connect 5V power connections
3. Connect 12V motor power
4. Connect Arduino pins to L293D
5. Connect motors to L293D outputs
6. Connect sensors to Arduino
7. Connect enable pins to 5V

TESTING SEQUENCE:
================
1. Power on Arduino
2. Check Serial Monitor for "DC Motor Control System Ready!"
3. Verify servo moves to center position (90°)
4. Test forward movement (30 seconds)
5. Test backward movement (1 minute)
6. Test turning movements
7. Test obstacle detection with ultrasonic sensor

TROUBLESHOOTING:
===============
- If motors don't move: Check power and enable connections
- If motors spin wrong direction: Swap motor terminal connections
- If ultrasonic doesn't work: Check TRIG and ECHO connections
- If servo doesn't move: Check signal wire connection
- If code doesn't upload: Verify all pin numbers match

SAFETY NOTES:
============
- Always disconnect power before making wiring changes
- Double-check all connections before powering on
- Use appropriate wire colors for different voltage levels
- Ensure proper grounding for all components
- Test each component individually before full system test
